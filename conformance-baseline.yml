# MCP Conformance Test Baseline
#
# This file documents known deviations from the MCP specification or expected test failures.
# It serves as a baseline for tracking conformance over time.
#
# Format:
#   - test_name: Name of the failing test
#     reason: Why it fails or why the deviation is acceptable
#     tracking: Issue number or plan to fix (optional)

# Example:
# - test_name: "tools/call with streaming"
#   reason: "Streaming tool responses not yet implemented"
#   tracking: "Phase 7 - will be implemented in future release"

# Current Status: All tests expected to pass
# Last Updated: 2026-01-22

notes:
  - The server implements MCP specification version 2025-06-18
  - Supports stdio transport (preferred for local development)
  - Supports Streamable HTTP transport (POST /mcp)
  - Supports SSE transport (GET /mcp) for backwards compatibility with 2024-11-05 clients
  - All transports use the same shared server instance and tool definitions
