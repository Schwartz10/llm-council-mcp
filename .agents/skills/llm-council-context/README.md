# LLM Council Context Skill

This skill helps agents craft concise, high‑signal context for `consult_llm_council` requests.

Highlights:
- Structured context briefs (goal, constraints, facts, avoid)
- Guidance on what to include vs omit
- Model selection flow using `list_models` when names are uncertain

See `SKILL.md` for the full workflow and examples.
